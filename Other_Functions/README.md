#Other Functions

This directory contains functions which don't fit with any one
specific class.

mstdlib in particular is just a collection of functions that are
too small for their own files, but still don't belong anywhere else.

<pre>
Future addition plans:
  Writing template versions of most mstdlib functions into new
    library files.
