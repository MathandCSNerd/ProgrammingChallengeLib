# ProgrammingChallengeLib

This is the collection of python libraries in my Programming Challenge Lib.

I mostly stick to the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). However, some bits of code were written far before I actually decided to put them into a library, so those parts might not conform neccessarily.

Future Plans
  Adding unit tests across the board
  Adding python version of useful methods and objects from the C++ portion of this library
